## linux

Clone in Linux Mint.

Try upload.

Some reason authticate with tokens correct but git push resulting in Error 403.

Still looking at the drivers, uploading to this site is fine via browser. But the terminal still need to work out.

What if we chose Ubuntu rather than Windows, or use a Windows virtual machine.
Can simply just upload via the Gui.
